# 📦 FL Studio project exporter
Automatically export all your projects as looped zip packages.

### 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] Automatically delete unused files after exporting project
- [ ] Continue actions right after project load instead of static delay

### 📖 Usage
Open FL Studio and make sure it is visible within your monitor. All buttons have to be visible!
Make sure you don't have any themes or GUI scaling applied!

1. Copy the path of the folder where all your projects are in. Projects nested in that folder are getting exported too!
2. Download `main.exe` from the release tab and execute it.
3. Allow or deny overwriting existing loop zip packages.
4. Option of deleting audio files is not implemented - ignore it.
5. Let it run!
